	abstract = {FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) are making their way into data centers (DC). They are used as accelerators to boost the compute power of individual server nodes and to improve the overall power efficiency. However, this approach limits the number of FPGAs per node and hinders the acceleration of large-scale distributed applications. We propose a system architecture to deploy large-scale DC applications on standalone FPGAs, independently of the number of CPUs. In our architecture, the FPGAs are directly attached to the DC network, making the FPGA infrastructure scalable and flexible. This FPGA infrastructure enables the creation of flexible multi-FPGA fabrics by connecting several FPGAs together over the DC network. We implemented a prototype of the network-attached FPGA and ported a distributed text-analytics application onto such a multi-FPGA fabric. We compared our approach with a SW-only implementation and an implementation accelerated with PCIeattached FPGAs. The results show that the network-attached FPGAs outperform both other implementations by large margins.},

In addition to FPGA performance improvements, OpenCL-based FPGA development toolchains have been developed and offered by FPGA vendors, which reduces the programming effort required as compared to the past. These improvements reveal the possibilities of realizing a concept to enable on-the-fly offloading computation at which CPUs/GPUs perform poorly to FPGAs while performing low-latency data movement. We think that this concept is one of the keys to more improve the performance of modern heterogeneous supercomputers using accelerators like GPUs. In this paper, we propose high-performance inter-FPGA Ethernet communication using OpenCL and Verilog HDL mixed programming in order to demonstrate the feasibility of realizing this concept. OpenCL is used to program application algorithms and data movement control when Verilog HDL is used to implement low-level components for Ethernet communication. Experimental results using ping-pong programs showed that our proposed approach achieves a latency of 0.99 μs and as much as 4.97 GB/s between FPGAs over different nodes, thus confirming that the proposed method is effective at realizing this concept.},

	abstract = {The exploration of FPGAs as accelerators for scientific simulations has so far mostly been focused on small kernels of methods working on regular data structures, for example in the form of stencil computations for finite difference methods. In computational sciences, often more advanced methods are employed that promise better stability, convergence, locality and scaling. Unstructured meshes are shown to be more effective and more accurate, compared to regular grids, in representing computation domains of various shapes. Using unstructured meshes, the discontinuous Galerkin method preserves the ability to perform explicit local update operations for simulations in the time domain. In this work, we investigate FPGAs as target platform for an implementation of the nodal discontinuous Galerkin method to find time-domain solutions of Maxwell's equations in an unstructured mesh. When maximizing data reuse and fitting constant coefficients into suitably partitioned on-chip memory, high computational intensity allows us to implement and feed wide data paths with hundreds of floating point operators. By decoupling off-chip memory accesses from the computations, high memory bandwidth can be sustained, even for the irregular access pattern required by parts of the application. Using the Intel/Altera OpenCL SDK for FPGAs, we present different implementation variants for different polynomial orders of the method. In different phases of the algorithm, either computational or bandwidth limits of the Arria 10 platform are almost reached, thus outperforming a highly multithreaded CPU implementation by around 2x.},

Compared to regular grids, they allow resembling the computational domain with a much higher accuracy, which in turn leads to more efficient computations. There exists a wealth of supporting libraries and frameworks that aid programmers with the implementation of applications working on such grids, each built on top of existing parallelization technologies. However, many approaches require the programmer to introduce a different programming paradigm into their application or provide different variants of the code. SYCL is a new programming standard providing a remedy to this dilemma by building on standard C++ 17 with its so-called single-source approach: Programmers write standard C++ code and expose parallelism using C++ 17 keywords. The application is then transformed into a concrete implementation by the SYCL implementation. By encapsulating the OpenCL ecosystem, different SYCL implementations enable not only the programming of CPUs but also of heterogeneous platforms such as GPUs or other devices. For the first time, this paper showcases a SY CL-based solver for the nodal Discontinuous Galerkin method for Maxwell's equations on unstructured meshes. We compare our solution to a previous C-based implementation with respect to programmability and performance on heterogeneous platforms.},

These methods are different in nature from standard methods such as finite element or finite difference methods, often presenting a challenge in the transition from theoretical developments to actual implementations and applications. This book is aimed at graduate level classes in applied and computational mathematics. The combination of an in depth discussion of the fundamental properties of the discontinuous Galerkin computational methods with the availability of extensive software allows students to gain first hand experience from the beginning without eliminating theoretical insight.

A velocity–strain formulation is used, which allows for the solution of the acoustic and elastic wave equations within the same unified framework. Careful attention is directed at the derivation of a numerical flux that preserves high-order accuracy in the presence of material discontinuities, including elastic–acoustic interfaces. Explicit expressions for the 3D upwind numerical flux, derived as an exact solution for the relevant Riemann problem, are provided. The method supports h-non-conforming meshes, which are particularly effective at allowing local adaptation of the mesh size to resolve strong contrasts in the local wavelength, as well as dynamic adaptivity to track solution features. The use of high-order elements controls numerical dispersion, enabling propagation over many wave periods. We prove consistency and stability of the proposed dG scheme. To study the numerical accuracy and convergence of the proposed method, we compare against analytical solutions for wave propagation problems with interfaces, including Rayleigh, Lamb, Scholte, and Stoneley waves as well as plane waves impinging on an elastic–acoustic interface. Spectral rates of convergence are demonstrated for these problems, which include a non-conforming mesh case. Finally, we present scalability results for a parallel implementation of the proposed high-order dG scheme for large-scale seismic wave propagation in a simplified earth model, demonstrating high parallel efficiency for strong scaling to the full size of the Jaguar Cray XT5 supercomputer.},

The method is applied to turbulent channel flow at low Reynolds number, where it is found to successfully predict low-order statistics with fewer degrees of freedom than traditional numerical methods. This reduction is achieved by utilizing local hp-refinement such that the computational grid is refined simultaneously in all three spatial coordinates with decreasing distance from the wall. Another advantage of DG is that Dirichlet boundary conditions can be enforced weakly through integrals of the numerical fluxes. Both for a model advection-diffusion problem and for turbulent channel flow, weak enforcement of wall boundaries is found to improve results at low resolution.

Many TVD schemes are of method-of-lines form (i.e., discretized in spatial variables only); hence time discretizations that keep TVD and have other properties (e.g., large CFL numbers for steady state calculations, or high-order accuracy for time-dependent problems) are desirable. In this paper we present a class of m-step Runge–Kutta-type TVD time discretizations with large CFL number m, suitable for steady state calculations, and a class of multilevel type TVD high-order time discretizations suitable for time-dependent problems. Some preliminary numerical results are also given.},

	abstract = {We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic wave equations formulated as a linear hyperbolic system using first-order derivatives with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on 3-D unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives for flux calculation. In the DG framework, in contrast to classical FE methods, the numerical solution is approximated by piecewise polynomials which allow for discontinuities at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory of numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann-Problems can be applied as in the finite volume framework. To define a suitable flux over the element surfaces, we solve so-called Generalized Riemann-Problems (GRP) at the element interfaces. The GRP solution provides simultaneously a numerical flux function as well as a time-integration method. The main idea is a Taylor expansion in time in which all time-derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy–Kovalewski or Lax–Wendroff procedure which makes extensive use of the governing PDE. The numerical solution can thus be advanced for one time step without intermediate stages as typical, for example, for classical Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes. Due to the ADER time-integration technique, the same approximation order in space and time is achieved automatically. Furthermore, the projection of the tetrahedral elements in physical space on to a canonical reference tetrahedron allows for an efficient implementation, as many computations of 3-D integrals can be carried out analytically beforehand. Based on a numerical convergence analysis, we demonstrate that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured tetrahedral meshes and computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy can be reduced by higher-order schemes. Moreover, due to the choice of the basis functions for the piecewise polynomial approximation, the new ADER–DG method shows spectral convergence on tetrahedral meshes. An application of the new method to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytical and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established methods, confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER–DG approach for tetrahedral meshes provides a numerical technique to approach 3-D wave propagation problems in complex geometry with unforeseen accuracy.},

We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER–DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.},

	abstract = {We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous anelastic, seismic wave equations with arbitrary high order accuracy in space and time on 3-D unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Using the velocity–stress formulation provides a linear hyperbolic system of equations with source terms that is completed by additional equations for the anelastic functions including the strain history of the material. These additional equations result from the rheological model of the generalized Maxwell body and permit the incorporation of realistic attenuation properties of viscoelastic material accounting for the behaviour of elastic solids and viscous fluids. The proposed method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high order DERivatives for flux calculations. The DG approach, in contrast to classical FE methods, uses a piecewise polynomial approximation of the numerical solution which allows for discontinuities at element interfaces.

To this end, we introduce a new unrolled recursive algorithm for efficiently computing the Cauchy–Kovalewski procedure by making use of the sparsity of the system matrices. The numerical convergence analysis demonstrates that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured tetrahedral meshes while computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy can be reduced when applying higher degree approximation polynomials. In addition, we investigate the increase in computing time, when the number of relaxation mechanisms due to the generalized Maxwell body are increased. An application to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytic and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established numerical methods, confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER–DG approach for tetrahedral meshes including viscoelastic material provides a novel, flexible and efficient numerical technique to approach 3-D wave propagation problems including realistic attenuation and complex geometry.},

	abstract = {As FPGA performance and capabilities have increased substantially in recent years, FPGA-based designs are employed to implement complex functions and designs. The objective of our work is to design an interface between two FPGAs using I/O interface available inside FPGAs for the purpose of reliable communication. The two FPGAs will be connected via RS-232 port, to transfer data from one FPGA to another and vice versa. Our goal is to get a simple and reliable connection when two FPGAs communicate. The data information is created using Random Number Generator. We implemented our design using two Altera FPGA boards, implemented in Verilog™ language. Dynamic simulations were performed to verify the correctness of transmitted data. We had proposed a dice game as an application to show how two FPGAs can send and receive data to each other in full duplex direction. The two players generate a random number using Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) algorithm then send their number to each other using RS-232 cross cable. Finally, the values are compared and whoever gets the larger number wins the game.},

	abstract = {The architecture of the Microsoft Catapult II cloud places the accelerator (FPGA) as a bump-in-the-wire on the way to the network and thus promises a dramatic reduction in latency as layers of hardware and software are avoided. We demonstrate this capability with an implementation of the 3D FFT. Next we examine phased application elasticity, i.e., the use of a reduced set of nodes for some phases of an HPC application. We find that, for the FFT phase within Molecular Dynamics, such contraction is beneficial with a 13\%-14\% performance improvement. Turning to MD, we show how this elasticity can be integrated into the existing data transformation to hide its communication overhead and increase the performance benefit to 16\%-29\%.},

	doi = {10.1109/HPEC.2014.7040997},
	abstract = {The three dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (3D FFT) is widely applied in various scientific applications. Distributed 3D FFTs require global communication: this becomes a serious concern when strong scaling is required as in long timescale molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we propose a parameterized 3D FFT design that targets at a 3D-torus FPGA-based network of various sizes. Characteristics include direct FPGA-FPGA communication links, support for various internal switch designs, and use of table-based routing which saves chip area and routing cycles. We find that even assuming extremely conservative parameters, we are able to run the 163FFT in 3.9μs, 323FFT in 5.46μs, 643FFT in 9.52μs, and 1283FFT in 25.72μs. These results indicate that clusters based on commodity FPGAs are likely to be appropriate when strong scaling is needed in applications limited by the 3D FFT.},
