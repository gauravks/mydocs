\label{cha:Conclusion}

This thesis presents the benefits of using point-to-point communication between
FPGAs in the MIDG2 application for accelerating computation of electric and magnetic
fields using the \acl{DG} method. The \texttt{MIDG2 MPI FPGA} is extended to communicate
the shared data between FPGAs using point-to-point communication in two different
topologies viz. \texttt{within node} and \texttt{fully connected}.

The topologies are initially evalau
