	abstract = {Bioinformatics could greatly benefit from increased computational resources delivered by High Performance Computing. However, the decision-making about which is the best architecture to deliver good performance for a set of Bioinformatics applications is a hard task. The traditional way is finding the architecture with a high theoretical peak of performance, obtained with benchmark tests. But, this is not an assured way for this decision, because each application of Bioinformatics has different computational requirements, which frequently are much different from usual benchmarks. We developed a methodology that assists researchers, even when their specialty is not high performance computing, to define the best computational infrastructure focused on their set of scientific application requirements. For this purpose, the methodology enables to define representative evaluation tests, including a model to define the correct benchmark, when the tests endorsed by the methodology could not be fully used. Further, a Gain Function allows a reliable decision-making based on the performances of a set of applications and architectures. It is also possible to consider the relative importance between applications and also between cost and performance.},

The problem is that it uses complex heuristics which make it difficult to simultaneously achieve both substantial speed-up and exact agreement with the original output. We have previously described how a novel FPGA-based prefilter that performs exhaustive ungapped alignment (EUA) could be used to reduce the computation by over 99.9\% without loss of sensitivity. The primary contribution here is to show how the EUA filter can be combined with another filter, this one based on standard 2-hit seeding. The result is a doubling of performance over the previous best implementation, which itself is an order of magnitude faster than the unaccelerated original. Other contributions include new algorithms for both the original EUA and the 2-hit filters and experimental results demonstrating their utility. This new multiphase FPGA-accelerated NCBI BLASTP scales easily and is appropriate for use in large FPGA-based servers such as the Novo-G.},

	abstract = {The acceleration of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using high-performance reconfigurable computing (HPRC) has been much studied. Given the intense competition from multicore and GPUs, there is now a question whether MD on HPRC can be competitive. We concentrate here on the MD kernel computation: determining the short-range force between particle pairs. In one part of the study, we systematically explore the design space of the force pipeline with respect to arithmetic algorithm, arithmetic mode, precision, and various other optimizations. We examine simplifications and find that some have little effect on simulation quality. In the other part, we present the first FPGA study of the filtering of particle pairs with nearly zero mutual force, a standard optimization in MD codes. There are several innovations, including a novel partitioning of the particle space, and new methods for filtering and mapping work onto the pipelines. As a consequence, highly efficient filtering can be implemented with only a small fraction of the FPGA’s resources. Overall, we find that, for an Altera Stratix-III EP3ES260, 8 force pipelines running at nearly 200 MHz can fit on the FPGA, and that they can perform at 95\% efficiency. This results in an 80-fold per core speed-up for the short-range force, which is likely to make FPGAs highly competitive for MD.},

In this paper, we propose a novel FPGA-based acceleration solution with MapReduce framework on multiple hardware accelerators. The combination of hardware acceleration and MapReduce execution flow could greatly accelerate the task of aligning short length reads to a known reference genome. To evaluate the performance and other metrics, we conducted a theoretical speedup analysis on a MapReduce programming platform, which demonstrates that our proposed architecture have efficient potential to improve the speedup for large scale genome sequencing applications. Also, as a practical study, we have built a hardware prototype on the real Xilinx FPGA chip. Significant metrics on speedup, sensitivity, mapping quality, error rate, and hardware cost are evaluated, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed platform could efficiently accelerate the next generation sequencing problem with satisfactory accuracy and acceptable hardware cost.},

On the basis of three easy examples taken from our current research field, we show how RIVYERA can be applied to different kinds of problems regarding bioinformatics. RIVYERA is able to significantly speed up the process of exact sequence alignment using the Smith-Waterman [1] algorithm, querying protein sequence databases using BLASTp [2], and running genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using iLOCI [3] or similar methods based on contingency tables. Likewise, energy savings with RIVYERA are in the same order as runtime reductions compared to standard PCs or computing clusters.},

	abstract = {Complex diseases may result from many genetic variants interacting with each other. For this reason, genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) are currently performed to detect pairwise SNP interactions. While the computations required here can be completed within reasonable time, it has been inconvenient yet to detect third-order SNP interactions for large-scale datasets due to the cubic complexity of the problem. In this paper we introduce a feasible method for third-order GWIS analysis of genotyping data on a low-cost heterogeneous computing system that combines a Virtex-7 FPGA and a GeForce GTX 780 Ti GPU, with speedups between 70 and 90 against a CPU-only approach and a speedup of approx. 5 against a GPU-only approach. To estimate effect sizes of third-order interactions we employed information gain (IG), a measure that has been applied on a genome-wide scale only for pairwise interactions in the literature yet.},

	abstract = {HMMer is a commonly used package for biological sequence database searching with profile hidden Markov model (HMMs). It allows researchers to compare HMMs to sequence databases or sequences to HMM databases. However, such searches often take many hours on traditional computer architectures. These runtime requirements are likely to become even more severe due to the rapid growth in size of both sequence and model databases. We present a new reconfigurable architecture to accelerate the two HMMer database search procedures hmmsearch and hmmpfam. It is described how this leads to significant runtime savings on off-the-shelf field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).},

The computation kernels of HMMER, namely MSV and P7Viterbi are very compute intensive, and their data dependencies if interpreted naively, lead to a purely sequential execution. In this paper, we propose a original parallelization scheme for HMMER by rewriting the mathematical formulation, to expose hidden potential parallelization opportunities. Our parallelization scheme targets FPGA technology, and our architecture can achieve 10 times speedup compared with the latest HMMER3 SSE version, without compromising on the sensitivity of original algorithm.},

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},
