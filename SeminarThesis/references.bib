abstract={In the past few years we are witnessing increased interest in the research of inter-vehicle communications. Due to vehicle specific movement patterns new algorithms and solutions have to be developed. Clustering is a technique for grouping nodes in geographical vicinity together, making the network more robust and scalable. This article presents an overview of proposed clustering algorithms for use in vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). We survey different clustering algorithms and highlight their objectives, features, specialties and possible limitations. Varieties of different approaches have been observed whereby typically each one focuses on different performance metric. Diverse are also complexities of algorithms and the input data they use and relay on. With this article, readers can have a more thorough and delicate understanding of ad hoc clustering and the research trends in this area. The most promising solutions show the significance of reused concepts from the field of social network analysis.},

abstract = "Abstract Over the last few years, Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have emerged as a new class of efficient information dissemination technology among communities of users mainly because of their wide range of applications such as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Safety applications, and entertainment during the mobility of the vehicles. Vehicles in VANETs act as an intelligent machine, which provides various resources to the end users with/without the aid of the existing infrastructure. But due to the high mobility and sparse distribution of the vehicles on the road, it is a challenging task to route the messages to their final destination in VANETs. To address this issue, clustering has been widely used in various existing proposals in literature. Clustering is a mechanism of grouping of vehicles based upon some predefined metrics such as density, velocity, and geographical locations of the vehicles. Motivated from these factors, in this paper, we have analyzed various challenges and existing solutions used for clustering in VANETs. Our contributions in this paper are summarized as follows: Firstly, a complete taxonomy on clustering in VANETs has been provided based upon various parameters. Based upon this categorization, a detailed discussion is provided for each category of clustering which includes challenges, existing solutions and future directions. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of all the existing proposals in literature is provided with respect to number of parameters such as topology selected, additional infrastructure requirements, road scenario, node mobility, data handled, and relative direction, density of the nodes, relative speed, communication mode, and communication overhead. The analysis provided for various existing proposals allows different users working in this domain to select one of the proposals with respect to its merits over the others."

abstract = "Abstract Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is an emerging field of wireless networks providing different applications such as traffic information for participant vehicles and related authorities. However, deploying of such applications is mainly depending on the market penetration rate of this technology. In this paper, we propose a new 3-steps approach for estimation of traffic volume in a road segment based on actual volume of wireless-equipped vehicles. For this propose, we first collect the traffic information for different groups of vehicles using a new clustering algorithm. Then, a chaining technique between the clusters transmits this information to a roadside cloud. Finally, we employ a generalization method to extension of the total traffic volume from the collected data. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using extensive simulation for different traffic densities, and the stability of the clustering technique and also estimation accuracy of the proposed approach is shown in comparison with state-of-the-art existing schemes."

abstract={Many applications of inter-vehicle communication networks (IVC) rely on multi-hop dissemination of information using vehicle-to-vehicle communication. An example are traffic information systems, which aim to provide up-to-date information about traffic jams to drivers. Due to the large amount of information and wide dissemination ranges, naïve protocols fail to scale to multi-hop dissemination. Therefore, a wide range of efficient protocols has been investigated. While clustering protocols are successfully used for similar applications in other domains, such as wireless sensor networks, they have been neglected by IVC research, because they often fail due to high vehicle mobility. In this paper, we present a data-similarity-based approach for clustering in inter-vehicle networks, which is built to work in high mobility settings. In contrast to existing clustering proposals, we explicitly draw from knowledge gained during the development of other multi-hop dissemination mechanisms in general and in-network aggregation in particular. We demonstrate our approach with a clustering protocol proposal and show first evaluation results using theoretical analyses.},

abstract={We present a method for clustering vehicles that are in the same congested traffic flow. Our goal is to provide a mechanism for sharing information between vehicles in the same situation to ease traffic congestion in urban areas. Because the most accurate source of information about the congested traffic flow is the vehicle at the head of the traffic flow, it first needs to be identified. To do so, we adapt a clustering algorithm by trajectory abstraction. By grouping the vehicles that have the same or similar trajectory into the same cluster, the vehicle at the tail of the traffic flow can discover the vehicle at the head of the traffic flow. Moreover, we adapt an abstracted trajectory representation to compensate for the error in GPS information. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides a higher rate of correctness than existing commonly used clustering algorithms.},

Due to the features of VANET, data dissemination is an important issue that has to be addressed. In this paper we propose a direction based clustering algorithm for data dissemination. This protocol is used to estimate the density of vehicles on a given road. As in any clustering algorithm, the formation of the cluster and the use of the bandwidth are important tasks. In the proposed solution the packet is forwarded to vehicles only if they are moving along the same direction. The simulations show that the proposed protocol reduces the number of broadcast packets being sent on the network. To choose the best technology for VANET applications, the technologies 802.11p and 802.11b are compared with TCP/IP and Wireless Access Vehicular Environment (WAVE) stack protocols. This results obtained shows that WAVE stack is better than TCP/IP stack, in terms of performance, in vehicular environment.},

abstract={We present a lane-based clustering algorithm designed to provide stability in cluster lifetime for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in urban scenarios. Stable clustering methods reduce the overhead of re-clustering and lead to an efficient hierarchical network topology. During the creation of VANET clusters, cluster members select one member to be the clusterhead. Fewer clusterhead changes result in a more stable cluster. To achieve this goal, cluster members must select a member that has the potential to be a clusterhead longer than other cluster members. Our method aims to select a clusterhead based on the lane where most of the traffic will flow.},

abstract={The forthcoming Intelligent Transportation System aims to achieve safety and productivity in transportation using vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) to support the communications system required. Currently, some clustering approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of VANETs due to their dynamic nature, high scalability and load balancing results. However, the host mobility and the constantly topology change continue to be main problems of this technique due to the lack of models which represent the vehicular behavior and the group mobility patterns. Therefore, we propose an Adaptable Mobility-Aware Clustering Algorithm based on Destination positions (AMACAD) to accurately follow the mobility pattern of the network prolonging the cluster lifetime and reducing the global overhead. In an effort to show the efficiency of AMACAD, a set of simulation was executed. The obtained results reveal an outstanding performance in terms of the lifetime of the cluster heads, lifetime of the members and the re-affiliation rate under varying speeds and transmission ranges.},

abstract = "Abstract The need for an effective clustering algorithm for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is motivated by the recent research in cluster-based MAC and routing schemes. VANETs are highly dynamic and have harsh channel conditions, thus a suitable clustering algorithm must be robust to channel error and must consider node mobility during cluster formation. This work presents a novel, mobility-based clustering scheme for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks, which forms clusters using the Affinity Propagation algorithm in a distributed manner. This proposed algorithm considers node mobility during cluster formation and produces clusters with high stability. Cluster performance was measured in terms of average clusterhead duration, average cluster member duration, average rate of clusterhead change, and average number of clusters. The proposed algorithm is also robust to channel error and exhibits reasonable overhead. Simulation results confirm the superior performance, when compared to other mobility-based clustering techniques."

Constructing stable clusters by determining the vehicles sharing similar mobility pattern is essential in reducing the overhead of clustering algorithms. In this paper, we introduce VMaSC: Vehicular Multi-hop algorithm for Stable Clustering. VMaSC is a novel clustering technique based on choosing the node with the least mobility calculated as a function of the speed difference between neighboring nodes as the cluster head through multiple hops. Extensive simulation experiments performed using ns-3 with the vehicle mobility input from the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) demonstrate that novel metric used in the evaluation of the least mobile node and multi-hop clustering increases cluster head duration by 25% while decreasing the number of cluster head changes by 10%.},

We contrast this with the applicability of a more exact Two-Ray Interference model. A key result is that, in most cases, the commonly used simplified Two-Ray Ground models add no additional value compared to the most simple Free-space model - in particular in highway and suburban environments. We further argue that replacing a simplified with a fully featured Two-Ray Interference model can not only substantially improve the accuracy of simulation results but also allow capturing one notable artifact that becomes immediately visible in field tests, namely strong signal attenuation at short and medium ranges. We implemented the Two-ray Interference model within the Veins simulation framework and validated it using analytical predictions and field measurements. We show the impact of the more accurate Two-Ray Interference model, which only comes with negligible additional computational cost for simulation experiments.},
