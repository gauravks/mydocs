    This thesis captures an overview of ideas, techniques, results and future possibilities of clustering in vehicular networks.
    Clustering is a technique to group nodes based on a selected criteria which defines certain level of similarities among the nodes.
    Grouping the nodes together in such a way helps define or design a set of functionalities applicable only to the
    group and can be applied to the smaller sub-set. In a \ac{VANET} environment clustering presents possibilities
    to group vehicles based on a parameter of interest and help to reduce the network traffic, achieve better network throughput,
    effective information dissemination.

    The thesis presents a set of parameter and respective methodologies based on them for \ac{VANET}s as a comparative study.
    First chapter presents the motivation behind the clustering and outlines the basic set of problems which is presented by vehicular
    Networks which the researches are trying to address. The second chapter describes the methodologies grouping them based on the main
    parameters used for clustering. The third chapter introduces the evaluation techniques used to evaluate the methods along with some
    important metrics used to compare the effectiveness of the algorithms. The fourth chapter captures a comparative study based on
    the results, highlighting benefits and drawbacks of different approaches based on simulation results. Finally the thesis captures
    some ideas which will give an overview of the future research work on the topic.

%\chapter{Einleitung}
\label{sec:introduction}

Along with the advancement in wireless networking in the past two decades, there has been a lot of research targeted
towards developing techniques to minimize the network overhead and achieve effectiveness within the system. A special
class of wireless network, \ac{WANET},  which allowed nodes to communicate with each other without the need of
special infrastructure such as bridges and routers was developed. \ac{WANET} lead to use of wireless communication
for special applications with needs of distributed control. Shortly use of \ac{MANET} increased which allowed
continuos movement of the nodes. This was followed by use of wireless networking among vehicles to create \ac{VANET}
which allows communication of various parameters among vehicular focussed towards application for safety and cooperative
driving. The use of wireless networks in various domains has lead to a lot of research focussed towards improvements
and optimization which are often valid for all domains.

Clustering in wireless networks involves grouping nodes together which are geographically close to each other based on a
certain set of parameters. Parameter selection for clustering depends mostly on the type of application which would use
the clustered network. In \ac{VANET}s clustering of vehicles into groups provides a basis for limiting the networking
overhead and interference by efficiently defining the target nodes fr communication and designing filters to limit the traffic.
Due to the possibility of selecting huge range of parameters, numerous solutions have been proposed which target various
scenarios in the \ac{VANET}s. \cite{6256251} and \cite{BALI2014134} presents a detailed overview of research work in this
field in past years. In the following sections we would look at some of the important terminologies and parameters to create
a general overview of clustering in \ac{VANET} and help us to discuss and understand the methodologies better.

\section{Terminologies}

In this section we look at some of the common terminologies used widely across the algorithms
on clustering for \ac{VANET}s.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\ac{CM}:} All the nodes which are become part of the cluster and participate in the
          communication within the cluster.
    \item \textbf{\ac{CH}:} Each cluster is supposed to elect one of the \ac{CM} to act as the \ac{CH}
          based on some rules. Its possible for any \ac{CM} to be elected as the \ac{CH} but some of the algorithms
          may apply special requirements for a \ac{CM} to be elected to ensure stability of the cluster. The responsibilities
          of a \ac{CH} may vary but in general its responsible for the maintenance of the cluster
          (addition and removal of nodes) and communication with the external nodes (other \ac{CH}s and \ac{RSU}s).
    \item \textbf{\texttt{HELLO} Message:} Also referred as \texttt{DISCOVER}, is the first message sent by a vehicle to identify
          the presence of existing cluster. This is mostly a broadcast frame.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{INVITE} Message:} This is transmitted by a \ac{CH} or a \ac{CM} in respond to a received \texttt{HELLO} message
          if the requesting vehicle is found fit to join the cluster.
\end{itemize}

\cref{fig:cluster} shows a typical cluster organization with one \ac{CH} and multiple \ac{CM}s.

\chapter{Clustering methodologies}
\label{sec:methodologies}

In order to achieve a robust and effective communication in the high mobility environment, \ac{VANET} applications use various
parameters to cluster the nodes into meaningful sub-groups based on the applications requirement. This leads to a wide
range of clustering methodologies which define applications specific algorithms useful for respective application or
a generic algorithm with possibility to handle different requirements. In this chapter we discuss some of the common
parameters used individually or in combination with each other to define thresholds for vehicles to join cluster and
cluster head selection along with some methodologies which use them for clustering.

\section{Clustering Parameters}

Parameters play an important role to build stable cluster effectively which can be used to perform the application
specific communication with minimal overhead. Some of the common parameters which are used by the algorithms to
form basis for threshold calculation are summarized in \cref{tab:parameters}.

\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedright}p{3.5cm}p{7.5cm}}
        \hline
        Parameter               & Description                                                   \\

        Vehicular mobility      & This is the most common parameter used in the algorithms. Mobility of the vehicles are measured in terms of
                                relative velocity and average velocity over time of the vehicle \\
        Direction of the travel & In many cases information to shared between vehicles only has relevance if the vehicles share the same path
                                and direction. This is knowledge is used by the algorithms by forming trajectory tables or assigning Road IDs
                                to compare directions and route                                 \\
        Destination             & Used by application which give importance to route taken by the vehicles to provide longer stable cluster \\
        Density                 & Mostly used to differentiate sparse and dense networks and define different communication model to ensure reliable
                                communication in both scenarios                                               \\
        Unique ID               & Simplest clustering parameter. Commonly used to identify and cluster vehicles requiring 1 hop reliable communication \\
        Location                & Used with application requiring location based information such as intersection support and congestion avoidance \\
\end{longtable}

\section{Typical clustering Operations}

To group vehicles togethers there are two main set of operations used by the clustering algorithms. First is the cluster creation operations
as shown in \cref{fig:creation}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
    \subfloat[Cluster creation with single vehicle]{\label{fig:operation1}\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/cluster-step1}}%
    \vfill%
    \subfloat[Cluster creation with multiple vehicles]{\label{fig:operation2}\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/cluster-step3}}
    
	\caption{Cluster creation operations}
	\label{fig:creation}
\end{figure}

As the name suggest these operations are used to create a new cluster after verifying the fitness of the 
participants. \cref{fig:operation1} shows a case where there is no vehicle around. The vehicle first sends the \texttt{HELLO} messages to
discover presence of other cluster and after a certain timeout identifies that there is no one around and starts a new cluster becoming the
new \ac{CH}. The second operation depicted in \cref{fig:operation2} is used when there are vehicles in the vicnicity which have not yet formed
any cluster. In this case the the vehicles discover each other via \texttt{HELLO} messages and form a cluster followed by an election of the
\ac{CH}.

The second set of operations are used for cluster maintenance shown in \cref{fig:maintenance}. Cluster joining operations shown in \cref{fig:operation3}
is used to add new members to the cluster. The request to join is initiated by the vehicle by sending the \texttt{HELLO} message. When the \ac{CH} receives
this message, it verifies if the vehicle is fit to join the cluster and then invites it using \texttt{INVITE} message. Cluster merging happens when two
\ac{CH} come in contact with each other as shown in \cref{fig:operation4}. At this point the \ac{CH}s decide to merge the clusters if the current state of
the two cluster is similar in terms of the cluster parameters. After merging one of the existing \ac{CH} becomes the new \ac{CH} of the merged cluster and
the other \ac{CH} becomes a \ac{CM}.

It should be noted that the actual implementation of these operations may change from one methodology to another depending upon the parameter and the
uses case for the clustering.

\section{Methodologies}

This sections would present some of the methodologies which are popular and used as the basis for several algorithms designed for clustering
is \ac{VANET}.

\subsection{Clustering using vehicular mobility}

Vehicular mobility is one of the common and vastly used methodology for clustering. Relative velocity which can be used to differentiate
the vehicles into different sub-groups is used as one of the main parameters in such algorithms. The vehicle mobility is the main element
affecting the network topology which the algorithms use to estimate dynamicity of the network and improve stability. Clustering algorithms
presented in \cite{ARKIAN2014197, 6737622, 6077004} use relative velocity as the main parameter to define the cluster joining and cluster
head selection metrics.

\subsection{Clustering using direction and destination}

It has been identified that vehicles which travel in same direction or to same destination are supposed to be benefitted
most if they share information to each other. This makes the direction of travel and destination based clustering another
important parameters used for clustering. This methodology requires the vehicles to be equipped with \ac{GPS} devices to
get accurate location information. There can be variation based on the estimation and comparison of the routes of the
vehicles. The methodology presented in \cite{6685518} uses trajectory tables to store position information which is
then shared and compared by the vehicles to check the direction and route of travel whereas methodology presented
in \cite{5416361} calculates the direction at intersection points based on the turn the vehicles are going to take.
The solution proposed in \cite{5735785} uses lane based information to decide the direction and cluster the vehicles.

\subsection{Clustering using vehicular density}

Density of the vehicles is changed based on the environment considered. This is often utilized by the clustering
algorithm as a important parameter to define different communication methodologies for dense network in city vs
sparse network on highways. Aim of such algorithms is to reduce network congestion in cities by avoiding unnecessary
flooding and provide long range network coverage on highways using long range communication. \cite{4976256} discusses
one such algorithm which uses density based clustering to define different communication model based on connectivity and
link quality estimates.

\subsection{Hybrid clustering}

Some application may require use of more than one parameter to make decision. Clustering algorithms defined for such
application are complex and use multiple parameters in combination to each other. The clustering scheme proposed
in \cite{6077004} uses a combination of location, vehicular velocity and destination information to build up clusters
which can adapt with changes in any of the parameters. Such methods are always complex and require a lot of communication
between the vehicles to share real-time information.

\subsection{Multi-hop clustering}

The methodologies summarized till now in this section relies on one hop communication i.e. direct communication between
the \ac{CH} and the \ac{CM}. The one hop based communication clustered face the problem of frequent handoffs between
the clusters for members with high mobility. Multi-hop clustering methods try to address this issue by including N-hop
members to the cluster. As shown in \ref{fig:2hop} and \ref{fig:3hop}, the multi-hop members communicate to the \ac{CH}
via the intermediate members and can be located a maximum of N-hop distance away from the \ac{CH}. In a multi-hop
clustering methodology, the \texttt{HELLO} messages contain additionally the number of current hops and are re-broadcasted
by a node after adding themselves as a intermediate node. This forms the basis for identifying routes to the N-hop nodes
after clustering. The clustering schemes based on multi-hop are described in \cite{Zhang2069135, 6554933}.
