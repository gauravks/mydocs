	abstract = {FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) are making their way into data centers (DC). They are used as accelerators to boost the compute power of individual server nodes and to improve the overall power efficiency. However, this approach limits the number of FPGAs per node and hinders the acceleration of large-scale distributed applications. We propose a system architecture to deploy large-scale DC applications on standalone FPGAs, independently of the number of CPUs. In our architecture, the FPGAs are directly attached to the DC network, making the FPGA infrastructure scalable and flexible. This FPGA infrastructure enables the creation of flexible multi-FPGA fabrics by connecting several FPGAs together over the DC network. We implemented a prototype of the network-attached FPGA and ported a distributed text-analytics application onto such a multi-FPGA fabric. We compared our approach with a SW-only implementation and an implementation accelerated with PCIeattached FPGAs. The results show that the network-attached FPGAs outperform both other implementations by large margins.},

In addition to FPGA performance improvements, OpenCL-based FPGA development toolchains have been developed and offered by FPGA vendors, which reduces the programming effort required as compared to the past. These improvements reveal the possibilities of realizing a concept to enable on-the-fly offloading computation at which CPUs/GPUs perform poorly to FPGAs while performing low-latency data movement. We think that this concept is one of the keys to more improve the performance of modern heterogeneous supercomputers using accelerators like GPUs. In this paper, we propose high-performance inter-FPGA Ethernet communication using OpenCL and Verilog HDL mixed programming in order to demonstrate the feasibility of realizing this concept. OpenCL is used to program application algorithms and data movement control when Verilog HDL is used to implement low-level components for Ethernet communication. Experimental results using ping-pong programs showed that our proposed approach achieves a latency of 0.99 μs and as much as 4.97 GB/s between FPGAs over different nodes, thus confirming that the proposed method is effective at realizing this concept.},

	abstract = {The exploration of FPGAs as accelerators for scientific simulations has so far mostly been focused on small kernels of methods working on regular data structures, for example in the form of stencil computations for finite difference methods. In computational sciences, often more advanced methods are employed that promise better stability, convergence, locality and scaling. Unstructured meshes are shown to be more effective and more accurate, compared to regular grids, in representing computation domains of various shapes. Using unstructured meshes, the discontinuous Galerkin method preserves the ability to perform explicit local update operations for simulations in the time domain. In this work, we investigate FPGAs as target platform for an implementation of the nodal discontinuous Galerkin method to find time-domain solutions of Maxwell's equations in an unstructured mesh. When maximizing data reuse and fitting constant coefficients into suitably partitioned on-chip memory, high computational intensity allows us to implement and feed wide data paths with hundreds of floating point operators. By decoupling off-chip memory accesses from the computations, high memory bandwidth can be sustained, even for the irregular access pattern required by parts of the application. Using the Intel/Altera OpenCL SDK for FPGAs, we present different implementation variants for different polynomial orders of the method. In different phases of the algorithm, either computational or bandwidth limits of the Arria 10 platform are almost reached, thus outperforming a highly multithreaded CPU implementation by around 2x.},

Compared to regular grids, they allow resembling the computational domain with a much higher accuracy, which in turn leads to more efficient computations. There exists a wealth of supporting libraries and frameworks that aid programmers with the implementation of applications working on such grids, each built on top of existing parallelization technologies. However, many approaches require the programmer to introduce a different programming paradigm into their application or provide different variants of the code. SYCL is a new programming standard providing a remedy to this dilemma by building on standard C++ 17 with its so-called single-source approach: Programmers write standard C++ code and expose parallelism using C++ 17 keywords. The application is then transformed into a concrete implementation by the SYCL implementation. By encapsulating the OpenCL ecosystem, different SYCL implementations enable not only the programming of CPUs but also of heterogeneous platforms such as GPUs or other devices. For the first time, this paper showcases a SY CL-based solver for the nodal Discontinuous Galerkin method for Maxwell's equations on unstructured meshes. We compare our solution to a previous C-based implementation with respect to programmability and performance on heterogeneous platforms.},

These methods are different in nature from standard methods such as finite element or finite difference methods, often presenting a challenge in the transition from theoretical developments to actual implementations and applications. This book is aimed at graduate level classes in applied and computational mathematics. The combination of an in depth discussion of the fundamental properties of the discontinuous Galerkin computational methods with the availability of extensive software allows students to gain first hand experience from the beginning without eliminating theoretical insight.

A velocity–strain formulation is used, which allows for the solution of the acoustic and elastic wave equations within the same unified framework. Careful attention is directed at the derivation of a numerical flux that preserves high-order accuracy in the presence of material discontinuities, including elastic–acoustic interfaces. Explicit expressions for the 3D upwind numerical flux, derived as an exact solution for the relevant Riemann problem, are provided. The method supports h-non-conforming meshes, which are particularly effective at allowing local adaptation of the mesh size to resolve strong contrasts in the local wavelength, as well as dynamic adaptivity to track solution features. The use of high-order elements controls numerical dispersion, enabling propagation over many wave periods. We prove consistency and stability of the proposed dG scheme. To study the numerical accuracy and convergence of the proposed method, we compare against analytical solutions for wave propagation problems with interfaces, including Rayleigh, Lamb, Scholte, and Stoneley waves as well as plane waves impinging on an elastic–acoustic interface. Spectral rates of convergence are demonstrated for these problems, which include a non-conforming mesh case. Finally, we present scalability results for a parallel implementation of the proposed high-order dG scheme for large-scale seismic wave propagation in a simplified earth model, demonstrating high parallel efficiency for strong scaling to the full size of the Jaguar Cray XT5 supercomputer.},

The method is applied to turbulent channel flow at low Reynolds number, where it is found to successfully predict low-order statistics with fewer degrees of freedom than traditional numerical methods. This reduction is achieved by utilizing local hp-refinement such that the computational grid is refined simultaneously in all three spatial coordinates with decreasing distance from the wall. Another advantage of DG is that Dirichlet boundary conditions can be enforced weakly through integrals of the numerical fluxes. Both for a model advection-diffusion problem and for turbulent channel flow, weak enforcement of wall boundaries is found to improve results at low resolution.
